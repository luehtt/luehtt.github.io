# Question
How to trim unnecessary whitespace characters (including line break) from data in SQL

### Answer
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET field_name = TRIM(field_name);
UPDATE table_name SET field_name = TRIM(TRAILING '\n' FROM field_name);
UPDATE table_name SET field_name = TRIM(TRAILING '\r' FROM field_name);
UPDATE table_name SET field_name = TRIM(TRAILING '\r\n' FROM field_name);
```
Line #1 is used to trim space characters. Line #2 and later are used to trim all line break characters. If needed to trim other character (such as tab character) use the same pattern as line #2
